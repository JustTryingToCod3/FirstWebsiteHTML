    <p>
        Ghost stories; who hasn’t heard them? However, not many people would consider the possibility of a real-life ghost encounter. Most people think ghost stories are just that: stories. I was one of those people. In the back of my mind, I wanted to believe he was telling a lie, but I got the sense that he was serious. I had an intuitive feeling that he either saw a ghost, or he saw something. I was curious but skeptical. Most ghost stories, in my opinion, are fabricated lies...most. So I interviewed him and his mother, listening closely like a detective on the case, seeing if there were any flaws, cracks, or loose ends in the story. But most of all, I listened with genuine interest; seeking to learn more, and testing to see if my intuition was correct.
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
        “Is there any other possible explanation for what you have seen?” I asked Mrs. Wilder, Anthony’s mother, 8 years after the incident.
        <br>
        “Not really,” she answered, pulling her brown hair behind her ear. “And considering Anthony witnessed this ghost with me, it is not likely to have been a hallucination.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        I asked Anthony the same question.
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
        “Anything is possible: hallucinations, illusions, bad food. But the chance of the events having to occur for us both to see the same thing at the same time seems just as, or even less likely than something from the other side so to speak.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        “How old were you?” I asked Anthony because I wasn’t there to witness it myself. 
    </p>
    
    <blockquote>
        “It was the Easter of 2009,” he replied. “So I would have been 7.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Easter of 2009 was a day he’d never forget. Like most 7-year old boys, he was curious, energetic, and would sometimes get himself into mischief. He was a short brown-haired boy with bright eyes and a big heart. In addition, he was a deep thinker. Along with his curiosity, he always had the feeling there was something more than just this mortal life, and this mortal body. The idea that there was something beyond the normal, was always speculation of his. But he never gave it too much thought. That is, until the night his speculation aligned with his reality.
    </p>

    <p>
        Back in 2009, he lived in his grandmother’s house in Roswell, New Mexico. It was a large house; a haunted house. It was a maze of hallways stretching from one side to the other. The dining room branched to the next room, and the next, leading to the sunroom in the back. The house was always kept tidy: scrubbed floors, clean furniture with bright floral designs, and spotless windows. The house was not perfect, but it was beautiful. The one who owned the house, his grandmother, was a strict, conservative, community-centered woman. She was oddly obsessed with porcelain statues, and she filled her house with them. Also, she was always busy with... something. But Anthony never really knew what. He knew she went to some type of red hat society meeting. But that’s all he knew. His mom, on the other hand, hated Roswell. She didn’t exactly… fit in. She was more spiritual than conservative. She looked and acted much different than the rest. She was more of a dreamer who didn’t care as much about community meetings as the grandmother. She felt that there was something more to this life, more to life than just small-town Roswell. His mother and grandmother were two different people. As a result, they would argue furiously in the kitchen, giving the house a potent negative atmosphere. They would argue about his grandmother’s food, and how it was too bitter, sweet, or salty. They’d argue about the rent and trivial things like who cleans up after the dinner dishes. There was no way to tell if their tempers attracted this paranormal presence. There’s no way to tell if this ghost was just curious to see who was ruining her vibe.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anthony had an intuition that could sense when something wasn’t right. At first, he just brushed this weird feeling off as just the negative vibe produced from the arguing. But then, the feeling persisted. He knew there was something wrong, when his dog, Maya, began to act up by barking at a specific room in the house.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “The hallway to the ghost’s room was right when you came in,” he said. “And on the right, there was the rest of the house.”
        <br>
        “My dog at the time would constantly bark and whine at the door to the room almost shaking; but would refuse to enter,” Anthony told me. “As for myself, I would get a splitting headache when I would walk in the room. You would get a feeling that something wasn't right about the room.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        “The dog you had at the time, would it bark at people, like the mailman?” I asked. I asked him this because I wanted to see if it was the ghost who caused the dog to overreact, or if the dog naturally barked at anyone and anything.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “No,” He answered.
        <br>
        “Was it usually a calm dog?”
        <br>
        “Yes,” He answered. “Until she lost her sight a couple of years later.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        As Anthony claims, his dog was not one to be excited, bark much, or beg for attention. When the mailman came, the dog would watch him leave. If someone came by, the dog would find a nice place to nap in the corner. She calmly enjoyed play-time and walks, and food from the dinner table. So that’s why it came as a surprise, to Anthony, when way before the encounter, this chubby, tan, pug sensed something was wrong; something was there. When he found Maya barking, no, yelping, at the door at the end of the hall. When hearing this, I concluded that this yelping must have been caused by some paranormal presence; something it could see, but he couldn't. A shiver overtook the whole dog’s body, and the yelp turned into a steady whine. It would not advance, but it retreated, slowly, and steadily, behind Anthony’s ankles.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anthony went to investigate.
    </p>

    <p>
        There must have been something that agitated Maya. Whatever was behind that door, he was going to find out. Inch by inch, he made his way to the door. The dog, with newfound courage in the presence of her owner, followed close at his heels. But she did not dare to venture ahead of the safety of Anthony. As Anthony approached, he felt what seemed like a wave of feeling in his brain followed by a blistering headache. He wrinkled his brow. Whatever’s behind this door, must have some meaning. He placed his hand on the knob, trying to ignore the waves of pain in his head that got progressively worse as he approached. The dog stopped. She would not go any further. He opened the door.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hats. Nothing but hats. Everywhere. His grandmother’s blood-red, community hats. He looked back at the shivering dog.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “See, it’s not that bad,” Anthony consoled the whimpering pet. But really, he was consoling himself. He couldn’t shake this eerie feeling he had. A few days later, this feeling became a reality.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        “What were you doing when you saw it?” I asked Anthony and his mother during the interview.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “It was late at night,” he said. “I was on the couch trying to sleep when my mom came to check on me.”
        <br>
        “I had awoken from sleep just a few minutes before this sighting,” Mrs. Wilder said. “I felt like I was being watched and decided to go to the living room to check on Anthony.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        As I questioned them further about the event, their testimonies of what happened aligned perfectly… too perfectly. What he said, she agreed, and what she said, he agreed. There were snippets of what she said in his testimony, and what he said in hers. I couldn’t help but believe they were telling the truth… or talking to each other. At this moment, I had three possible reasons circling in my head. Either they saw something, they both hallucinated, or this story was a setup just simply to help me with my homework. However, I had a hard time believing the latter two. If this story was fabricated, then their testimonies would have been slightly contradictory. I had interviewed them both separately, so someone should have made a claim that didn’t necessarily align with the other. And just like Mrs. Wilder said, it was highly unlikely they hallucinated the same thing. And, apparently, in Mrs. Wilder’s opinion, the grandmother knew about it too.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “From what Dante’s grandmother told me,” said Mrs. Wilder. “She was probably someone who had lived in the area around the 1800s.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        What I heard next, went against all my expectations. I usually expected ghost stories to be scary like the movies. I honestly expected someone to be dragged by their ankles across the living room. But I was shocked.
    </p>

    <p>
        According to Mrs. Wilder, the moon had risen high in the sky, and it was time for a peaceful sleep. But Mrs. Wilder just tossed and turned. She had this uncanny feeling in the pit of her stomach; this odd feeling she was being watched. She tried to brush the thought out of her mind, but it persisted. It grew into worry. No matter how much she tried to fight the thought out of her mind, it fought violently for her attention. Finally, she gave in. Something wasn’t right in the house. Something felt… off. At that moment, all she could think about was her son. Was he safe? Well, there was no harm in making her way to the living room to check. She quickly pulled herself out of bed and went down to see if her son was ok.
    </p>

    <p>
        Anthony was wide awake. He looked up at his mother from the couch with wide, tired eyes. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Mrs. Wilder tried to console her son, but he could tell she felt the same thing. She made her way, slowly, from behind the couch, and around the arm, to sit next to Anthony’s feet. Instantly, at that moment, the temperature of the room plummeted, and goosebumps raised on their skin. Whatever it was, did it want to be seen? Did it want to be seen by both of them? Why did the temperature drop as soon as the mother sat next to her son? Was something calling for their attention, or were they attracting the attention of something; something that was always watching at a distance, but, now, wanted to get a closer look? Their muscles were frozen, as they stared helplessly at the wall. Before their fear-stricken eyes, a gray figure emerged from the living-room wall. It seemed to have come from the direction of the room full of hats.
    </p>

    <p>
        It... she... was pretty.
    </p>

    <p>
        She was dressed in apparel from the 1800s with rich, luxurious clothes, and neatly styled hair. She was not just a regular ghost. She looked like she came from money. With her head held high, she flaunted her presence like a peacock. She was in her late 20s to early thirties, with dark-like hair that gently swayed as she walked out of the wall, turned, and disappeared into the wall with her parasol open over her shoulder. She did not turn to look at Anthony or his mother. She didn’t stop, stare, or pause for even a second. It was like she was just passing through. That was the first, and last, they’d ever seen her.
    </p>

    <p>
        Afterward, they stared at each other in disbelief. Anthony nudged his mother, and she gave an approving look. She saw it too. No harm was done. No one screamed. No one was dragged across the living room. The lights didn’t turn on and off. Doors and windows weren’t locked. The temperature just dropped, she was there, and then she was gone. Even though they both believed in the paranormal, and life beyond this mortal one, it still came as a shock to them as the lady appeared, then disappeared.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “Who do you think they were? How they died etc.,” I asked Anthony.
        <br>
        “There’s no easy way to tell,” Anthony answered. “But she most likely lived on the property and was there when she died. A lot of the old houses have been redone and renovated. From what she was wearing I can tell she came from money. So perhaps she was in a family with a business.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        “Has anyone ever tried to speak to you?” I asked them.  
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “Not in that house,” Mrs. Wilder answered. “In the house, I grew up in, my grandfather who died in December of 2001 would try to communicate with me. He told me he loved me and that he was happy with Martha (his wife) and that he was ok.”
        <br>
        “I haven’t heard anything call or speak to me, fortunately,” answered Anthony. “However, as a kid, I would sometimes feel like something was trying to follow me or harm me. From my experience, ghosts, or whatever you would call them, “speak” more with actions or feelings. For example, when my mom, sister, and I lived in a trailer down here. Every time my mom made a certain dish that was my great grandpa’s favorite, something would happen; like the back door would fly open. My mom would tell me that she knew it was him.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        “What do you think they wanted?” I asked Anthony and his mother.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “I think that my great-grandpa just wanted to say hi or to let us know he was there,” Anthony replied. “Whatever was following me, however, felt a lot more sinister. I don’t know what it wanted with me.”
        <br>
        “He [her grandfather] wanted me to be able to let go of the pain from his passing so that I could move on with life,” Mrs. Wilder answered. “As for the ghost in Roswell, I think she just wanted to see who was in her house.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        “How did you feel during and after the encounter?” I asked Mrs. Wilder.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “It was pretty creepy. People are not supposed to walk through walls,” she answered.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        I asked Anthony the same question. 
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “It was shocking, to say the least; like a strange suspected truth had come to life. I felt a cold shiver go through me a little bit after. My mom and I were both speechless, looking at each other to see if we both saw what happened,” he answered.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        “Strange suspected truth?” I asked. 
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “I always thought there was something off about the house. That room in particular,” Anthony explained.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        And his intuition was not wrong. His speculation turned out to be right. There is evidence that emotions can travel from being to being. The headaches and the feelings of being watched could have originated from her: the ghost. The Journal Of Alternative And Complementary Medicine by Dean I. Radin, (Ph.D.) and Marilyn J. Schlitz, (Ph.D.) on Gut Feelings, Intuition, and Emotions, conducted an experiment consisting of two people, usually lovers or long-term friends, who were connected to an EGG (electrogastrogram). Person S and person R were asked to exchange a meaningful item like a ring or a watch that would make the two feel as though they have a personal, emotional, connection. Person R was seated in a sensory-deprived room and told to completely relax. Person S was put in another room 15 feet away, and given noise-canceling headphones. S was to receive emotionally stimulating photos and music, look at a monitored screen of person R and was told to try and transfer the feeling to the person in the next room. When the person “transferred” the feeling, that emotion was read to be felt in the next person, but only slightly; like a sense, a gut feeling. It concludes: “This experiment suggests that some somatic feelings may be associated with perceptions transcending ordinary sensory capabilities. Of course, it would be imprudent to assume that all gut feelings necessarily contain intuitive information, as on occasion visceral sensations reflect little more than a bad burrito. But assuming that future studies can successfully replicate the present results, it may turn out that the “belly brain” is more perceptive than previously suspected, and that common reports of gut feelings having special intuitive qualities may have a basis.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Well, if feelings can be transferred from the living to the living, can they be transferred from the dead to the living as well? Bone-chilling right? As Anthony said, the ghost would never speak to him with words, but with feelings. So, when Anthony trusted his intuition, it didn’t fail him. His intuition was the only way this being could alert him of its presence.
    </p>

    <p>
        “What message do you have for the reader?” I asked Anthony.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        “I guess what I took away from it was that it doesn't take belief to know that something's wrong with a place. I was a skeptic, but I always thought there was something off about the house,” he answered. “I think there was a reason I couldn't sleep and that my mom came out. And that could be that someone wanted to be seen.”
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        And that someone was seen; witnessed by a mother and a son, left speechless in their living room, but glad to be able to live to tell the tale.
